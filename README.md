### Web3 Authentication - One Time Nonce
Example Project for signing in/authentication with blockchain(EVM) using one time nonce.

In the context of cryptography, any piece of signed data can be verified to ensure that a specific account ( *public address* ) had approved it. This mechanism allows authenticating any account that had signed it's corresponding nonce ( *message* ) value without revealing it's private key!

#### Important: 
*Web3 Authentication does not require any interaction with the blockchain.*
